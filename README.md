The quiz has been integrated at the quiz page, located in the info folder.

Basically, the quiz has 5 questions with 4 choices each. You have to select a choice first then click submit to validate that answer.
The user may also click the previous button or the next button to navigate through questions that have already been answered.
Going to previous questions would only allow you to see the correct answers, not your previous answers.

After submitting your answer to the fifth question, your score is then displayed with some feedback.
