        <h1>What's the truth behind poverty?</h1>
        <hr>
        <h2>Definition</h2>
        <p>
            Poverty is globally defined as the inability to afford the necessities, whether it be food, shelter, education, etc. Lack of financial wealth is the primary reason for poverty. This is the definition that I have observed through my studies.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Identifying Causes</h2>
        <p>
            As we have defined earlier, lack of wealth is the primary reason for poverty. As how this is the primary cause of poverty, there are also causes that cause poverty.
        </p>
        <p>
            An example of such is the lack of education. We, humans, correlate education with financial success. This is mostly true as we can observe this effect in the real world. This cause could have also been caused by the lack of wealth in the family. <i>Can you see the repeating chain of cause and effect?</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>This forms another reason</i>. It is because the family hasn't broken through the chain of poverty.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Relating Poverty to Education</h2>
        <p>
            As you can see, we have formed a cause-and-effect relation between those two concepts. Concluding that, lack of education <i>may</i> cause poverty, and that poverty <i>may</i> cause the lack of education.
        </p>
        <p>
            Breaking this cause-and-effect chain made the Philippine Government give free education to <i>anyone</i>. This is the solution that the government came up with.
        </p>
        <p>
            But of course, as we can observe here, that only works to a certain extent. One reason for such is discouragement, as a child may want to help their family, causing them to work and eventually quit school.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is why solving poverty entirely at our current state is <i>impossible</i>.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Wrapping up the identification of causes</h2>
        <p>
            Let's have a table of causes that may contribute to poverty.
        </p>
        <!-- List in tabular format -->
        <table class="float-right">
            <tr>
                <th>Causes that may affect poverty</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Lack of education</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Unemployment</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Destructive natural phenomena</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Lack of support from the government</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Increase in population</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
            As we can see here, these are just some of the causes that cause poverty.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unemployment removes a financial source in the family, which <i>may</i> cause lack of wealth in that family.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another cause is the destructive natural phenomena, which can destroy resources that may have been left behind, resulting in the loss of wealth.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lack of support from the government has a large impact on poverty as well since they're supposed to help with the issue as they are currently trying to do right now. Without that, poverty would be much worse.
        </p>
        <p>
            A large increase in population can also be a cause, as having a larger amount of people means that there would much more resources needed, resulting in a lack of resources, which may cause a lack of wealth.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            In conclusion, we have discussed that there is a cause-and-effect chain between education and poverty. We had also identified some of the causes that cause poverty. Trying to solve poverty requires solving one or more of the causes that affect it. As
            they always say, <i>identify and solve the root cause first.</i></p>
